        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I'm a civic entrepreneur, ecosystem builder, multihyphenate creator, speaker, mentor, and son</p>
        <article>
            <h3>A New Chapter: Focusing on all things "Hyperlocal"</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/a-new-chapter.png" alt="A New Chapter" width="100">
            <p>Building Civics Unplugged was a dream.</p>
            <p>Beyond the joy of supporting so many young civic innovators explore their passions and skills, I am grateful for how much time it gave me to explore the roots of civilizational decline and fragility.</p>

            <h3>Civics Unplugged</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/civics-unplugged.png" alt="Civils Unplugged" width="100">
            <p>In May 2019, I broke Google's "Golden Handcuffs" because it became clear to me that if far more isn‚Äôt done to train a new generation of leaders committed to civic innovation, humanity will sink under the weight of its greatest challenges‚Äîincluding the climate crisis, skyrocketing inequality, and rising geopolitical tensions.</p>
            <p>This is where Civics Unplugged came in. I co-founded CU to empower Gen Z civic innovators to direct their passions, creativity, and idealism toward building a better future.</p>

        <h2>My podcast</h2>
        <p>As of September 2022, the focus of my thinking has turned toward my new podcast called "LEVEL UP AMERICA" , which profiles inspiring entrepreneurs building tech serving America's public interest.</p>
        <p>Simply put, I think the doomers who say America's downfall is coming are wrong. You'll see why when you hear from the builders who will join me on my podcast.</p>
